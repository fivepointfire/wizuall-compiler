# Page 3: Introduction

The WizuAll project is a custom compiler for a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to simplify data analysis and visualization. The language allows users to write concise, readable scripts for data manipulation, mathematical computation, and the generation of a wide variety of plots (line, bar, scatter, pie, box, heatmap, etc.) using Pythonâ€™s matplotlib.  
This report details the design, implementation, and refinement of the WizuAll compiler, including its grammar, preprocessor, semantic analysis, scanner, parser, syntax-directed translation, target code generation, and error handling strategies.

# Pages 4-6: Design

## 4.1 Grammar

The grammar of WizuAll is defined using Bison/Yacc. It supports:
- Variable assignments
- Vector and matrix literals
- Mathematical and logical expressions
- Function calls (e.g., `avg`, `sort`, `reverse`, `slice`, `transpose`, `runningSum`, `pairwiseCompare`, `paretoSet`)
- Control structures (`if-else`, `while`, `for`)
- Visualization calls (e.g., `plot`, `histogram`, `heatmap`, `barchart`, `piechart`, `scatter`, `boxplot`, `timeline`)
- Keyword arguments for visualizations

**Example Grammar Snippet:**
```yacc
Program
    : StatementList                { final_ast = createProgramNode($1); }
    ;

Statement
    : Assignment SEMICOLON
    | ControlStructure
    | VisualizationCall SEMICOLON
    | FunctionCall SEMICOLON
    ;
```

## 4.2 Preprocessor

The preprocessor is minimal, as WizuAll is designed to be a scripting language. Comments (`// ...`) are stripped by the lexer. The preprocessor could be extended for macros or includes in future versions.

## 4.3 Semantics

Semantic actions are embedded in the grammar rules. They build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using C structs. Each node type (assignment, function call, visualization, etc.) is represented by a specific struct.  
Semantic checks include:
- Type checking for expressions
- Ensuring correct number and type of arguments for functions and visualizations
- Handling of keyword arguments

## 4.4 Scanner

The scanner (lexer) is implemented using Flex. It recognizes:
- Identifiers
- Numbers (integers and floating point, e.g., `4.1`, `100.2`)
- Strings
- Operators and delimiters
- Keywords

**Key improvements:**
- The NUMBER regex was refined to support only valid floating point and integer numbers.
- The `%union` in the parser was updated to use `double` for floating point support.

---

# Pages 7-8: Parser

The parser is built with Bison/Yacc and uses the grammar described above.  
**Key features:**
- Builds the AST for the entire program.
- Handles operator precedence and associativity.
- Supports both positional and keyword arguments for visualizations.
- Allows expressions as values for keyword arguments (e.g., `labels=labels`).

**Error Handling in Parser:**
- Custom error messages with line and column numbers.
- Graceful recovery from common syntax errors.

**Example:**
```yacc
VizArg
    : ID ASSIGN STRING
        { ... }
    | ID ASSIGN Expression
        { ... }
    | Expression
        { ... }
    ;
```

# Pages 9-10: Syntax-Directed Translation (SDT)

SDT is used to translate the AST into Python code.  
**Key points:**
- Each AST node has a corresponding code generation function.
- Visualization nodes generate Python matplotlib code.
- Function calls and expressions are translated to Python equivalents.
- Control structures are mapped to Python `if`, `while`, and `for` statements.

**Example:**
- `boxplot([x, y, z]);` in WizuAll becomes:
  ```python
  plt.boxplot([x, y, z], notch=False, vert=True, patch_artist=True, tick_labels=['Data 1', 'Data 2', 'Data 3'])
  ```

# Pages 10-11: Target Code Generation (Python Integration for Plotting)

The code generator outputs Python code that:
- Imports necessary libraries (`matplotlib`, `numpy` as needed).
- Suppresses matplotlib warnings at the very top of the file.
- Handles all visualizations, ensuring correct argument mapping and default values.
- Dynamically generates tick labels for boxplots to match the number of datasets.
- Handles floating point numbers with full precision.
- Supports both interactive and non-interactive environments.

**Special Handling:**
- For `plt.show()` warnings, the generator inserts:
  ```python
  import warnings
  warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning, module="matplotlib")
  ```
  at the very top of the file.

# Remaining Pages: Refinement (Error Handling)

## Error Handling and Refinement

### 1. **Lexer/Parser Errors**
- Custom error messages with line and column numbers.
- Clear feedback for invalid tokens, unexpected input, and mismatched parentheses/brackets.

### 2. **Semantic Errors**
- Checks for undefined variables.
- Ensures correct number and type of arguments for functions and visualizations.
- Reports errors for unsupported operations or invalid argument types.

### 3. **Runtime Errors in Generated Python**
- The generated code is robust against common Python errors (e.g., mismatched tick labels, invalid data types).
- Default values and error checks are inserted where possible (e.g., for boxplot tick labels).

### 4. **User Experience Refinements**
- All warnings from matplotlib are suppressed to avoid confusion in non-interactive environments.
- The code generator ensures that all output is clean and ready for use or further modification.

### 5. **Testing and Validation**
- Multiple test cases were created for both visualization and non-visualization features.
- Edge cases (e.g., floating point parsing, empty vectors, mismatched labels) were specifically tested and handled.
